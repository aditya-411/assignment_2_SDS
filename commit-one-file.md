#Solution for commit one file
we have to commit only 1 of the 2 files which were created. I choose to commit A.txt. Solution:
1) git add A.txt            (add A.txt to staging)
2) git status               (confirm only A is in staging and will be the only file commited)
3) git commit               (commit the file)
4) git verify               (verify completion of the exercise)
